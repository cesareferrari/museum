I began this work on "Questionable Characters" soon after getting some doll molds from another artist. These molds are over 50 years old and some are seconds as well. A few months before the start of the Covid-19 Lockdown, developing this series of casting and manipulating the "heads" made me consider the different individuals that the "dolls" could portray. As the dolls are a representation of a generic/ideal, It's my hope that by altering these "doll" forms and presenting them in a different context, one can discover how our perceptions of these ideals can be manipulated.
 

I have also included stoneware "Roosters"to be "Questionable Characters". The Roosters are a good contrast to the "Heads", as they are thrown and handbuilt.  These were made towards the end of 2019, and just finished/glazed in 2021.
 The Photographs are local landscapes of Bald Eagle State Park, and Fisherman's Paradise that I have taken over the past few years.
