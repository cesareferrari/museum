“Lend your ears to music, open your eyes to painting, and … stop thinking!” This quote, by Wassily Kandinsky, captures Marica Tacconi’s approach as an abstract expressionist artist. 

She paints while listening to music, mostly classical, but also jazz and music from non-Western cultures. 

Her paintings have been described as “having rhythm” and as incorporating harmony of form and color. Indeed, much of her inspiration comes from sound and from the connections between the aural and the visual. 

Exploring color, texture, and movement, she is drawn to non-representational, free-flowing art that develops and “takes shape” as she engages in the process. Her approach is intuitive, unstructured, and rhapsodic—almost like “stream-of-consciousness” on canvas.
