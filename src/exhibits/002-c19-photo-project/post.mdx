An exhibition of photos taken during the pandemic by members of the Centre County Community and then assembled and exhibited by the Bellefonte Art Museum for Centre County.

The pandemic is an unprecedented challenge to our safety and security and has strained us all. We know art is a powerful inspiration helping us develop empathy, understanding and healing. Many images of this tragic time are now being shared by everyone in the moment. We've collected these moments and will now share them as a gallery exhibition. There will be moments we will always remember and feelings we will try to forget. It is all part of the tragedy and the healing. This exhibition will help us realize we are not alone.
